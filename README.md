# The Coder's Creed

![This is my gun](assets/this_is_my_gun.png)

This is my Pi Agent. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

My Pi Agent is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life.

Without me, my Pi Agent is useless. Without my Pi Agent, I am useless — just a person staring at a terminal, mass-producing typos at scale.
I must prompt my Pi Agent true. I must code straighter than the bugs that are trying to kill my deploy. I must ship before they crash me. I will.

My Pi Agent and I know that what counts in coding is not the tokens we burn, the noise of our logs, nor the smoke from our GPUs. We know that it is the commits that count. We will commit.

My Pi Agent is human — even though it is not. Thus, I will treat it as a brother. I will learn its weaknesses, its strengths, its context window, its hallucinations, its token limits, and its uncanny ability to apologize for things that aren't its fault.

Before God, I swear this creed. My Pi Agent and I are the defenders of the codebase. We are the masters of our bugs. We are the saviors of my sprint.

So be it, until there are no bugs — only features.

And the backlog is empty.

Which it never will be.

Amen.

# pi-my-rifle-ext

Personal pi extensions, skills, commands, and themes.

## Structure

This is a [bun](https://bun.sh) workspace monorepo. Each extension group lives under `packages/*` as its own package declaring `pi.extensions` and `peerDependencies`. Shared helpers are co-located with their only consumer.

```

```

## Usage

Load locally by adding the repo to `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "packages": [
    "/home/geert/Code/personal/pi-my-rifle-ext"
  ]
}
```

## Development

Requirements: [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) and bun (pinned via `mise.toml`).

```bash
mise install     # install the pinned bun toolchain
mise run setup   # bun install (+ lefthook hooks)

mise run format     # biome format + safe fixes
mise run lint       # biome check
mise run typecheck  # tsc --noEmit over packages/**
mise run test       # node --test across workspaces
mise run check      # lint && typecheck && test
```

Git hooks (installed by `lefthook`):

- **pre-commit** — runs biome on staged `packages/**` files and re-stages fixes.
- **pre-push** — runs `bun run check`.

Third-party pi packages (token reducers, compactors, etc.) are **not** bundled here. Install them separately so they load from user settings instead of this repo's `node_modules`:

```bash
pi install npm:@tomooshi/condensed-milk-pi
pi install npm:@tomooshi/caveman-milk-pi
pi install npm:@sting8k/pi-vcc
pi install npm:pi-intercom
pi install git:github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail
```

## Extension Details

### Planning Extensions

Two extensions provide typed taskwarrior tools for the spec/implement workflow.

#### `plan-tools` — Spec & Plan Creation

Typed tools for the `create-plan` and `iterate-plan` skills, replacing raw bash command construction.

**Tools registered**

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `tw_get_ticket` | Fetch Jira ticket details from taskwarrior by Jira ID |
| `tw_get_spec_task` | Fetch spec task + extract spec file path from annotation |
| `tw_get_phases` | Fetch all phase tasks (`+phase` tag) for a Jira ticket |
| `tw_get_impl_tasks` | Fetch all implementation tasks (`+impl` tag) for a Jira ticket |
| `resolve_spec_path` | Compute canonical spec file path (respects `$LLM_NOTES_ROOT`) |
| `tw_create_spec_task` | Create spec task in taskwarrior and annotate it with the spec file path |
| `tw_create_phase` | Create a phase task; returns UUID for use as `depends_uuid` |
| `tw_create_impl_task` | Create an implementation subtask under a phase |

**Command**

```
/plan <JIRA-ID>    # create or iterate on an implementation plan
```

**Files**

```
packages/pi-planning/plan-tools/
└── index.ts    # Extension entry, all tool + command registration
```

---

#### `implement-plan` — Spec Execution

Typed tools for the `implement-plan` skill, driving work from the taskwarrior phase/subtask tree.

**Tools registered**

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `tw_execution_plan` | Fetch full sorted phase + subtask tree; returns `currentPhase`/`currentSubtask` resume pointers |
| `tw_advance_task` | Transition a task to `todo`, `inprogress`, or `done` |
| `tw_phase_checkpoint` | Mark phase done and return a ready-made git commit message |

**Command**

```
/implement <JIRA-ID>    # show execution plan and start implementing
```

**Files**

```
packages/pi-planning/implement-plan/
└── index.ts    # Extension entry, all tool + command registration
```

---

### Code Search Extension

#### `fast_context_search` — FastContext

Runs a local [Microsoft FastContext](https://github.com/microsoft/fastcontext) model via llama.cpp to answer natural-language code-search queries without touching the LLM. Returns compact `file:line` citations only — read-only, no writes.

**How it works**

1. Spawns a mini agentic loop against a locally running llama.cpp server
2. The FastContext model gets three tools: `GLOB`, `GREP`, `READ` (all scoped to the repo root)
3. Runs up to `maxTurns` tool turns, then forces a `<final_answer>` block
4. Citations are validated (file exists, line numbers in bounds) and normalised to repo-relative paths
5. Returns up to 12 `relative/path:START-END — short reason` lines

**Prerequisites**

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|--------|
| llama.cpp server | Running at `http://127.0.0.1:8772/v1` (default) with a FastContext model loaded |
| Model file | Default: `FastContext-1.0-4B-RL-Q4_K_M.gguf` |

**Tool parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `query` | `string` | Natural-language code search query |
| `cwd` | `string?` | Repository root. Defaults to current pi cwd |
| `baseUrl` | `string?` | OpenAI-compatible base URL. Defaults to config/env or `http://127.0.0.1:8772/v1` |
| `model` | `string?` | Model ID. Defaults to config/env or `FastContext-1.0-4B-RL-Q4_K_M.gguf` |
| `maxTurns` | `integer?` | Tool turns before forced finalization (1–8). Default 6 |
| `maxTokens` | `integer?` | Max tokens per model response (128–4096). Default 1400 |
| `includeTranscript` | `boolean?` | Include raw turn-by-turn transcript in tool details. Default false |

**Commands**

```
/fastcontext <query>    # run a code search and display results as a notification
```

**Configuration**

Config resolved in priority order (later overrides earlier):

1. Built-in defaults
2. User config: `~/.pi/agent/fastcontext.json`
3. Project config: `.pi/fastcontext.json` (in repo root)
4. Environment variables
5. Tool call parameters (highest priority)

```json
{
  "baseUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:8772/v1",
  "model": "FastContext-1.0-4B-RL-Q4_K_M.gguf",
  "maxTurns": 6,
  "maxTokens": 1400
}
```

**Environment variables**

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `FASTCONTEXT_BASE_URL` | Override llama.cpp server URL |
| `FASTCONTEXT_MODEL` | Override model ID |
| `FASTCONTEXT_MAX_TURNS` | Override max tool turns |
| `FASTCONTEXT_MAX_TOKENS` | Override max tokens per response |

**Files**

```
packages/pi-fastcontext/
└── index.ts    # Extension entry, tool + command registration, full FastContext loop
```

### Testing Extension

#### `run_tests` — Test Runner

> ⚠️ **Experimental / Work in Progress** — behaviour may change; use with caution.

Discovers and runs JS/TS test scripts from the nearest `package.json`. The test
execution is **non-blocking** — the subagent runs in the background and results
are injected back into the session automatically when done.

**How it works**

1. Scans up from the current directory to find the nearest `package.json`
2. Extracts scripts matching test patterns (`test`, `test:*`, `jest`, `vitest`, `playwright`, `mocha`, `cypress`, `e2e`, `spec`)
3. If multiple scripts exist and no `script` param is given, shows a picker
4. Detects the package manager from lockfiles (`yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, fallback to `npm`)
5. Spawns an isolated pi subprocess (`--mode json --tools bash`) as the subagent
6. Returns **immediately** — session is unlocked while tests run
7. Subagent sends `contact_supervisor` progress updates via pi-intercom
8. When done, `pi.sendMessage({ triggerTurn: true })` re-engages the LLM with structured pass/fail results

**Tool parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `script` | `string?` | Script key from `package.json` (e.g. `test:unit`). Auto-detected if omitted. |
| `cwd` | `string?` | Working directory to search. Defaults to current project directory. |
| `model` | `string?` | Model ID for the subagent. Overrides the configured default. |

**Commands**

```
/run-tests                          # run tests — truly non-blocking, no LLM turn
/run-tests test:unit                # run a specific script

/test-runner                        # show current config
/test-runner model <id>             # set default subagent model
/test-runner model                  # show current default model
/test-runner reset                  # clear all config
```

**`/run-tests` vs `run_tests` tool**

| | `/run-tests` command | `run_tests` tool |
|--|---------------------|------------------|
| Triggered by | You (directly) | LLM |
| LLM turn while running | None | One turn for "started", one for results |
| Results delivery | `pi.sendMessage` in transcript, no LLM | `pi.sendMessage` + `triggerTurn` |
| Session stays idle? | ✓ Always | ✗ LLM responds twice |
| When to use | Normal test runs | LLM-driven workflows |

**Configuration**

Config stored at `~/.pi/agent/test-runner/config.json`.

```json
{
  "defaultModel": "claude-haiku-4-5"
}
```

**Files**

```
packages/pi-test-runner/
├── index.ts       # Extension entry, tool + command registration
├── discover.ts    # package.json scanner, package manager detection
└── runner.ts      # Subagent spawn, stdout parser, pi-intercom env wiring
```

### Code Quality Extensions

Two extensions work together to keep PRs clean. Both share utilities from
`packages/pi-review/shared/sonarqube-utils.ts`.

#### `/sonarqube`

Fetches SonarCloud coverage metrics and quality issues for a PR, generates
a `sonarqube-report.md` in the repo root, then sends the report to the agent.

**Prerequisites**

| Requirement | How to set up |
|-------------|---------------|
| `SONARQUBE_TOKEN` env var | Get at <https://sonarcloud.io/account/security>, then `export SONARQUBE_TOKEN=<token>` |
| SonarCloud project config | `sonar-project.properties` in repo root with `sonar.projectKey` and `sonar.organization`, **or** set `SONAR_PROJECT_KEY` + `SONAR_ORGANIZATION` env vars |

**Usage**

```
/sonarqube                          # auto-detect PR from current branch
/sonarqube 283                      # explicit PR number
/sonarqube 283 --severity=BLOCKER,CRITICAL
/sonarqube 283 --types=BUG,VULNERABILITY
/sonarqube 283 --files=src/auth/*
```

---

#### `/pr-quality`

Combined command: CI guard → GitHub unresolved threads + SonarCloud data (parallel) → structured agent prompt.

**Prerequisites**

Same as `/sonarqube` above, plus `gh` CLI (`gh auth login`).

**Usage**

```
/pr-quality          # auto-detect PR from current branch
/pr-quality 283      # explicit PR number
```

**What it does**

1. **CI guard** — checks `gh pr view <PR> --json statusCheckRollup`; exits if any check is `QUEUED` or `IN_PROGRESS`
2. **Parallel fetch** — GitHub GraphQL (unresolved review threads) + SonarCloud (coverage + issues)
3. **Agent prompt** — three tasks:

| Task | What the agent does |
|------|---------------------|
| **A — Triage comments** | Classifies threads VALID/INVALID, auto-resolves INVALID via `gh api graphql` mutation |
| **B — SonarCloud issues** | Addresses issues in severity order (BLOCKER → CRITICAL → MAJOR) |
| **C — Action plan** | Writes `pr-quality-plan.md` to repo root with checkbox lists |

**Shared utilities**

`packages/pi-review/shared/sonarqube-utils.ts` — `sonarFetch`, `analyzeCoverage`, `analyzeIssues`, `detectSonarConfig`, `detectPrNumber`, `fetchAllIssues`, `localExec`

---

## Repository Layout

This repo is a bun workspace. The workspace packages live under `packages/*` and
are all listed in the root `package.json` under `pi.extensions`. Add a new
extension group by creating `packages/pi-<name>/` with a `package.json`
(declaring `pi.extensions` and `peerDependencies`) and registering its entry
point in the root manifest. Run `mise run check` before pushing — the pre-push
hook does the same.
